An African warrior who was captured at about age 16, Pierpoint lived his remaining years in exile. From his birth in Bundu (now part of Senegal) around 1744 until his death in rural Ontario in 1837, Pierpoint’s life allows us to glimpse the activity of an African involved in some of the world’s great events. \"We are indebted to the authors for breathing life into this man, who though taken from his home early in his life still was able to make a significant contribution to the early history of Upper Canada. He fought, farmed and became a giant to the Black community. We thank you for a wonderful story of this often forgotten segment of Canadian history.\" — Wilma Morrison, Norval Johnson Heritage Library, Niagara Falls \"Everybody knows about the Underground Railroad and the great many Black souls who emigrated to Canada via this route, but very few people know the brave Black men and women who put their lives on the line in defence of this country.\" — Ivor Christopher, Re-enactor, Runchey’s Company of Coloured Men \"A well-researched and highly readable chronicle of Richard Pierpoint’s life in Africa and North America — as a slave, a soldier, and as a pioneer in Upper Canada’s wilderness. ... a vitally important contribution to Canadian Black history.\" — Linda Brown-Kubisch, Author, Missouri",

I would never, as was once needlessly feared in this court, be a fugitive from justice in this country, only a seeker of it.\" —Conrad Black, in his statement to the court, June 24, 2011 In 1993, Conrad Black was the proprietor of London's Daily Telegraph and the head of one of the world's largest newspaper groups. He completed a memoir in 1992, A Life in Progress, and \"great prospects beckoned.\" In 2004, he was fired as chairman of Hollinger International after he and his associates were accused of fraud. Here, for the first time, Black describes his indictment, four-month trial in Chicago, partial conviction, imprisonment, and largely successful appeal. In this unflinchingly revealing and superbly written memoir, Black writes without reserve about the prosecutors who mounted a campaign to destroy him and the journalists who presumed he was guilty. Fascinating people fill these pages, from prime ministers and presidents to the social, legal, and media elite, among them: Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, George W. Bush, Jean Chrétien, Rupert Murdoch, Izzy Asper, Richard Perle, Norman Podhoretz, Eddie Greenspan, Alan Dershowitz, and Henry Kissinger. Woven throughout are Black's views on big themes: politics, corporate governance, and the U.S. justice system. He is candid about highly personal subjects, including his friendships - with those who have supported and those who have betrayed him - his Roman Catholic faith, and his marriage to Barbara Amiel. And he writes about his complex relations with Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, and in particular the blow he has suffered at the hands of that nation. In this extraordinary book, Black maintains his innocence and recounts what he describes as \"the fight of and for my life.\" A Matter of Principle is a riveting memoir and a scathing account of a flawed justice system.

This book presents the cumulative knowledge and practical experience acquired over nearly a decade of integrating PBL in courses in a wide range of disciplines.This \"how to\" book for college and university faculty. It focuses on the practical questions which anyone wishing to embark on PBL will want to know: \"Where do I start?\"???\"How do you find problems?\"???\"What do I need to know about managing groups?\"???\"How do you grade in a PBL course?\"The book opens by outlining how the PBL program was developed at the University of Delaware--covering such issues as faculty mentoring and institutional support--to offer a model for implementation for other institutions.The authors then address the practical questions involved in course transformation and planning for effective problem-based instruction, including writing problems, using the Internet, strategies for using groups, the use of peer tutors and assessment. They conclude with case studies from a variety of disciplines, including biochemistry, pre-law, physics, nursing, chemistry, political science and teacher educationThis introduction for faculty, department chairs and faculty developers will assist them to successfully harness this powerful process to improve learning outcomes.",

Tracing the origins of major humanitarian organizatins such as the International Commitee of the Red Cross, Medecins San Frontieres, and CARE, he describes how many of them have moved from their founding principles of neutrality - which gave them access to victims - to encouraging the international community to take action to stop civil wars and ethnic cleansing. ieff demonstrates how this advocacy has come at a high price. By overreaching, the humanitarian movement has allowed itself to be hijacked by the major powers, sometimes to become a fig leaf for actions that major powers take in their own national interests, as in Afghanistan, sometimes for their inaction, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. With an exception of cases of genocide, where the moral imperative to act overrides all other considerations, Rieff contends that if humanitarian organizations are to continue doing",
